Hello there. I am Gui. ðŸ’¬ I am in my second decade in tech. The last decade was fascinating. I scratched the surface of this immense and constantly evolving area which is software development, mastering various languages and the different approaches to run your code and deliver tech experiences; towards the last half of the first decade, I went deeper into the cloud and developer operations, with a mix of security at the application level.

I hope to explore ðŸ”­ the next decade using all the knowledge I accumulated to thrive on a personal business project (or at least have fun failing ðŸ˜„) and continue learning new skills and exchanging knowledge with different people in different fields.
