Hello there. I am Gui. ðŸ’¬ I am on my second decade as a software engineer. The last decade was incredibly exciting. I scratched the surface of this immense and always evolving area that is software engineering, mastering various languages and the different approaches to write and operate system. Towards the last half of the first decade I went deeper into the cloud, developer operations and experience.

I hope to explore ðŸ”­ the next decade using all the knowledge that I accumulated to thrive on different projects (or at least have fun failing ðŸ˜„) and continue to learn new skills and exchange knowledge with different people in different fields.
