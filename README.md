Hello there. My name is Gui. 💬 I am in my second decade in tech. The last decade was fascinating. I scratched the surface of this immense and constantly evolving area, software engineering, mastering various languages and approaches to run your code and deliver tech experiences. Towards the last half of the first decade, I went deeper into the cloud and developer operations, with a mix of security at the application level.

I hope to explore 🔭 the next decade using all the knowledge I accumulated to thrive on a business project (or at least have fun failing 😄) and continue learning new skills and exchanging knowledge with different people in different fields.
