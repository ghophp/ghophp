Hello there 👋🏻 I am on my second decade as a software engineer. The last decade was incredibly exciting. I scratched the surface of this immense and always evolving area that is technology, mastering various languages and the different approaches to write and operate system at scale. Towards the last half of the first decade I went deeper into the cloud, system reliability engineering and developer experience.

I hope to explore 🔭 the next decade using all the knowledge that I accumulated to thrive on different projects (or at least have fun failing 😄) and continue to learn new skills and exchange knowledge with different people.
