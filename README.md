Hello there. Call me G. ðŸ’¬ I have written code and assembled systems professionally for over 15 years. I scratched the surface of this immense and constantly evolving area, mastering various languages and approaches to run your code and deliver tech experiences. Towards the last eight years, I have focused on the cloud, developer and business operations, with a mix of security at the application level. I am delivering large-scale and ever-evolving solutions for different industries.

I hope to explore ðŸ”­ the next decade using all the knowledge I accumulated to thrive on delivering rich tech experiences, continuing to learn new skills and exchanging knowledge with different people in different fields.
